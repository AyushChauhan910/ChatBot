## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Predefined Query Processing**: Responds to 6 main financial queries
- **Partial String Matching**: Recognizes queries with partial keywords
- **Case Insensitive**: Handles queries regardless of capitalization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unknown queries
- **Help System**: Built-in help command showing available queries

### Supported Queries
1. **"What is the total revenue?"** - Calculates combined revenue across all companies
2. **"Which company has the highest revenue?"** - Identifies revenue leader
3. **"What is Tesla's growth rate?"** - Provides Tesla's growth analysis
4. **"How has Microsoft's net income changed?"** - Shows Microsoft's profitability trends
5. **"Compare revenue across companies"** - Detailed cross-company comparison
6. **"What is Apple's recent performance?"** - Apple's recent financial performance

### Data Sources
The chatbot uses financial data extracted from SEC 10-K filings:

**Microsoft Corporation**
- Fiscal Year 2024: Revenue $245,122M, Net Income $88,136M
- Fiscal Year 2023: Revenue $211,915M, Net Income $72,361M
- Growth Rate: 15.7% (2023-2024)

**Tesla, Inc.**
- Fiscal Year 2023: Revenue $96,773M
- Fiscal Year 2022: Revenue $81,462M, Net Income $12,556M
- Fiscal Year 2021: Revenue $53,823M, Net Income $5,524M
- CAGR: 34.0% (2021-2023)

**Apple Inc.**
- Fiscal Year 2024: Revenue $391,035M
- Fiscal Year 2023: Revenue $383,285M
- Fiscal Year 2022: Revenue $394,328M
- Growth Rate: 2.0% (2023-2024)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The chatbot uses a simple object-oriented design with the following components:

1. **FinancialChatbot Class**: Main chatbot logic and data storage
2. **Query Processing**: If-else statement based query matching
3. **Response Generation**: Methods for each supported query type
4. **Data Storage**: Dictionary-based financial data structure

### Algorithm
```python
def simple_chatbot(self, user_query):
    # Convert to lowercase and strip whitespace
    user_query_lower = user_query.lower().strip()

    # Direct query matching
    if user_query_lower in self.queries:
        return self.queries[user_query_lower]()

    # Partial matching with keywords
    elif "keyword" in user_query_lower:
        return appropriate_response()

    # Default response for unknown queries
    else:
        return error_message_with_help()
```

### Command-Line Version
- Interactive loop accepting user input
- Real-time query processing
- Graceful exit with 'quit' or Ctrl+C
- Input validation and error handling

### Web Version (Flask)
- RESTful API endpoints
- JSON-based request/response format
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- Interactive web interface with example queries

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages: Flask (for web version)

### Installation
1. Extract all files from the zip archive
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Command-Line Version
```bash
python financial_chatbot.py
```

### Running the Web Version
```bash
python flask_chatbot.py
```
Then open your browser to: http://localhost:5000

### Sample Usage
```
You: What is the total revenue?
Chatbot: Total combined revenue: Microsoft (2024): $245,122M, Tesla (2023): $96,773M, Apple (2024): $391,035M. Combined total: $732,930M

You: Tesla growth
Chatbot: Tesla demonstrates exceptional growth with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 34.0% from 2021-2023...
```

## Limitations

### Functional Limitations
1. **Limited Query Set**: Only responds to 6 predefined queries and their variations
2. **Static Data**: Financial data is hardcoded and not dynamically updated
3. **No Context Awareness**: Each query is processed independently
4. **Simple Matching**: Uses basic string matching, not natural language processing
5. **No Learning Capability**: Cannot learn from user interactions

### Data Limitations
1. **Limited Companies**: Only covers Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple
2. **Incomplete Data**: Some financial metrics missing for certain years
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Data is static from the time of extraction
4. **Limited Metrics**: Only covers 5 financial metrics per company
5. **No Data Validation**: No verification of financial data accuracy

### Technical Limitations
1. **No Machine Learning**: Uses rule-based logic instead of AI/ML
2. **No Database**: Data stored in memory, not persistent
3. **Limited Scalability**: Not designed for high-volume usage
4. **No Authentication**: No user management or access control
5. **Basic Error Handling**: Limited error recovery capabilities

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Fuzzy String Matching**: Better query recognition with typos
2. **More Companies**: Expand to include additional Fortune 500 companies
3. **Additional Metrics**: Include ratios, margins, and trend analysis
4. **Data Citations**: Add source references for financial data
5. **Export Capabilities**: Allow users to export query results

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Natural Language Processing**: Implement NLP for better query understanding
2. **Machine Learning**: Add ML models for predictive analysis
3. **Real-time Data**: Connect to live financial data feeds
4. **Database Integration**: Implement persistent data storage
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Add trend analysis, forecasting, and insights
6. **Multi-modal Interface**: Voice and graphical query interfaces
7. **User Personalization**: Custom dashboards and saved queries
